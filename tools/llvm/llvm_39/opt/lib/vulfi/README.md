VULFI
=====
#### Version 1.0
## Introduction

VULFI is an instruction-level fault injection framework developed using LLVM compiler infrastructure. VULFI performs fault injection at LLVM's intermediate representation (IR) level. Any front-end compiler which generates LLVM IR can be targeted for fault injection using VULFI. VULFI has been extensively tested with C++ and ISPC languages. It is capable of injecting faults into both vector and scalar instructions.
